Just walked out of The Amateur and honestly, my brain feels like it’s been put through a blender on low-speed and I wonder if my back will ever forgive me (those seats gettin’ medieval on me). The vibe in the theater was chaotic, crumbs everywhere, like I’m wearing a popcorn bracelet now—and the noise, people chattering like seagulls fighting over a french fry.

The   itself, ha, was like a Hitchcock mystery got tangled up with a punk rock concert. Those bizarre scenes where the protagonist just stares at himself in the mirror, as if he’s trying to outstare a goldfish? I swear I was vibing on a genuinely cosmic level. And then the sudden cut to the searingly loud car chase—it felt like being jolted awake by an alarm clock that’s in a screaming contest. That chase was like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 squirrels race each other up and down tree trunks, only with more existential overtones.

> Going from that dreamy cinematography to sharp, almost unbearably bright shots… my eyes turned into something like disco balls by the end. Or maybe that was just the sticky floor reflecting from below. Anyway, the main guy kept muttering about time, as though time were a loaf of bread he couldn’t slice. Just as baffling as when you nod off during a lecture and wake up with zero understanding of the chalkboard hieroglyphics.

Someone asked earlier, if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or do a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 party, and now I'm thinking, yeah, buddy, this is one of those you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   with a group. So everyone can decrypt together – makes it feel like a cinematic escape room if you ask me.

Weirdly, there was this part where the dialogue seemed to loop, like an echo in a giant cave, and that kept ringing even after exiting the theater and okay, am sure it’s still echoing somewhere back there. Dude on my left kept whispering theories, and it was like eavesdropping on a Mad Hatter's tea party. Speaking of loops, wonder if I can loopback to reality or am I circling screens indefinitely?
